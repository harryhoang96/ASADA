# ASADA
This is an anti-depression application using Alexa and an Android app.




Acronym for Alexa Support Anti-Depression Application


This application is for the purpose of those that are depressed.  We 
hope to be able to prevent all forms of depression through the help 
of Alexa.  

ASADA's main purpose is to support and prevent depression that is too 
great for any person(s).  It is at these times that nobody should stand
alone.  We hope that Alexa will be there for support when nobody else 
can.
