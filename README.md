# ASADA
This is an anti-depression application using Alexa and an Android app.

Acronym for Alexa Support Anti-Depression Application

This application is intended to provide guidance to those that are depressed in a variety of forms. 
We hope to be able to prevent all forms of depression through the help of Alexa.
A survey will be issued to all users to diagnose the severity of the depression.
Once the survey is taken, the results will be used as a guideline to better provide
solutions for the user such as motivational quotes, sleeping advice, and eating advice.

ASADA's main purpose is to support and prevent depression that is too 
great for any person(s).  It is at these times that nobody should stand
alone.  We hope that Alexa will be there for support when nobody else 
can.
